# Universal UI/UX Design System Methodology

**Category:** ui-design
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Tags:** #design-system #methodology #semantic-tokens #responsive #accessibility

## Description

A comprehensive design methodology that adapts to any project type, focusing on semantic token architecture, color psychology, and systematic component design approaches. This prompt creates a complete design system foundation with universal principles that work across industries and project types.

## Prompt

```
I need you to create a comprehensive UI/UX design system using the Universal Design Methodology with the following systematic approach:

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Project type: [SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, healthcare, fintech, etc.]
- Target audience: [developers, consumers, professionals, etc.]
- Brand personality: [playful, serious, innovative, traditional, etc.]
- Industry: [technology, healthcare, finance, creative, etc.]

## 🎯 CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Apply these non-negotiable principles:

### 1. DESIGN SYSTEM FIRST MINDSET
- NEVER write custom styles directly in components
- ALWAYS define styles in the design system (index.css + tailwind.config.ts)
- USE semantic tokens exclusively (--primary, --accent, not direct colors)
- CREATE component variants instead of className overrides

### 2. SEMANTIC TOKEN ARCHITECTURE
Create HSL-based semantic tokens:

```css
:root {
  /* Base semantic tokens - ALWAYS HSL format */
  --primary: [hsl values];           /* Main brand color */
  --primary-glow: [lighter variant]; /* Interactive states */
  --accent: [hsl values];           /* Secondary brand */
  --secondary: [hsl values];        /* Supporting elements */
  
  /* Functional tokens */
  --gradient-primary: linear-gradient(135deg, primary, accent);
  --shadow-glow: 0 0 40px hsl(var(--primary) / 0.3);
  --transition-smooth: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
```

## 🎨 COLOR SYSTEM METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: Brand Analysis & Color Psychology
Analyze using this framework:
- What does this brand/app represent?
- What emotions should users feel?
- What industry/domain conventions exist?
- Who is the target audience?

**Color Psychology Reference:**
- Red: Energy, urgency, passion, danger
- Blue: Trust, professionalism, calm, technology
- Purple: Creativity, luxury, innovation, magic
- Green: Growth, nature, success, health
- Orange: Enthusiasm, warmth, creativity, fun
- Yellow: Optimism, happiness, attention, caution
- Black/Dark: Premium, sophisticated, modern
- White/Light: Clean, minimal, pure, medical

### Step 2: Color Harmony Selection
Choose ONE harmony type:

**Complementary:** Opposite colors (high contrast)
- Primary: 220° (blue) → Accent: 40° (orange)

**Analogous:** Adjacent colors (harmonious)  
- Primary: 220° (blue) → Accent: 190° (cyan)

**Triadic:** 120° apart (balanced)
- Primary: 220° → Accent1: 340° → Accent2: 100°

**Monochromatic:** Same hue, different saturation/lightness
- Primary: 220° 91% 55% → Accent: 220° 91% 75%

## ✨ ANIMATION & EFFECTS SYSTEM

Define four animation categories:

1. **ENTRANCE ANIMATIONS**
```css
@keyframes fade-in-up {
  0% { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(30px) }
  100% { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0) }
}
```

2. **HOVER/INTERACTION EFFECTS**
```css
.hover-scale { 
  @apply transition-transform duration-200 hover:scale-105 
}
```

3. **AMBIENT ANIMATIONS** (subtle, continuous)
```css
@keyframes float {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0px) }
  50% { transform: translateY(-10px) }
}
```

4. **ATTENTION-GRABBING** (sparingly used)
```css
@keyframes glow {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1 }
  50% { opacity: 0.5 }
}
```

## 🏗️ COMPONENT VARIANT STRATEGY

Create systematic component variants:

```tsx
const buttonVariants = cva("base-classes", {
  variants: {
    variant: {
      default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground",
      hero: "bg-gradient-primary hover:shadow-glow hover:scale-105",
      accent: "bg-accent hover:shadow-accent",
      ghost: "hover:bg-accent/10",
      outline: "border-primary text-primary hover:bg-primary/10",
      destructive: "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground"
    }
  }
})
```

## 📐 SPACING & TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM

### Consistent Spacing Scale (8px base unit)
```css
gap-2: 8px    /* Tight elements */
gap-4: 16px   /* Default spacing */
gap-6: 24px   /* Card padding */
gap-8: 32px   /* Section elements */
py-12: 48px   /* Small sections */
py-16: 64px   /* Medium sections */
py-24: 96px   /* Large sections */
```

### Typography Hierarchy (Mobile-first)
```css
text-sm     → text-base    /* Body text */
text-lg     → text-xl      /* Subheadings */
text-2xl    → text-4xl     /* Section headings */
text-4xl    → text-6xl     /* Page headings */
text-5xl    → text-7xl     /* Hero headings */
```

## 🎯 PROJECT ADAPTATION WORKFLOW

Execute this systematic approach:

### Step 1: Discovery & Analysis (5 minutes)
1. Identify project type and industry context
2. Define target audience and technical proficiency
3. Establish brand personality traits
4. Research industry design conventions

### Step 2: Color Palette Creation (10 minutes)
1. Choose primary color based on brand psychology
2. Select appropriate harmony type
3. Calculate accent colors using color theory
4. Define neutral grays for backgrounds/text
5. Create semantic tokens in index.css

### Step 3: Design System Setup (15 minutes)
1. Update index.css with color tokens
2. Create gradients and effect tokens
3. Update tailwind.config.ts with semantic references
4. Define animation keyframes
5. Plan component variants needed

### Step 4: Component Enhancement (ongoing)
1. Enhance components with project-specific variants
2. Never use className overrides - always extend variants
3. Test dark/light mode compatibility
4. Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance
