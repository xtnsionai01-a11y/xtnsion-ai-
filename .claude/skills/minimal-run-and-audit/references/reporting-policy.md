# Reporting Policy

## Tone

Keep reports short, factual, and easy to audit.

## Requirements

- separate facts from inferences
- mention the documented command explicitly
- mention whether the non-training run was full, partial, smoke-only, sanity-only, or blocked
- explain the main blocker without burying it
- when patches were applied, mention patch state briefly in `SUMMARY.md` and keep the full audit in `PATCHES.md`

## Output priorities

1. clear overall result
2. copyable commands
3. concise process trace
4. stable machine-readable state
5. patch evidence when relevant

## Avoid

- long narrative journals
- vague "it should work" language
- hiding unsupported assumptions
- treating training startup or resume as part of this skill
